              The fast-paced sidescroller where you platform as a glass sliding along the bar.
              The winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop! (~30 participants)
              The main thing I learned from this game was how to be flexible and to adapt within tight deadlines. We were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, a prominent MS Paint animation, and more!

              A character-focused narrative fantasy RPG made in two weeks. I honed my leadership skills as we undertook this large project.
              We each wrote a character quest, and I learned to give up control, trust my teammates, and bring the quests together into a cohesive narrative.

              I have been managing a gaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unlimitedwill">YouTube channel</a> for over 6 years.
              I showcase some of the most difficult and astounding levels made in the Super Mario Maker 2 community, and have amassed over 1000 followers.
              I upload a new video twice a week on average, and the aspect of this project I'm most proud of is that I've never gone a week without uploading a new video.<br>
              I also frequently livestream myself playing on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unlimitedwill">Twitch</a>. <br>
              <br>
              Another one of my passions in gaming is speedrunning. I have been involved in speedrunning in Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario Bros, and Mario Wonder,
              and I was even invited to PACE Summer 2023, a charity speedrunning event where I played RubberRoss's Mario Maker levels at a break-neck pace.<br>
              RubberRoss is a well-known YouTuber and streamer notorious for making very hard Mario stages, and he was floored by my ability to circumvent his challenges, as seen below. <br>

              Offline, I've enjoyed collaborating on several other projects.
              I led a <a href="https://digital.wpi.edu/show/pz50h184z">project</a> working with the US Forest Service to develop lesson plans for students in New Hampshire.
              I've always loved being part of a team, devoting several years to football, lacrosse, and basketball teams.

            <p>
              Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design.
              So far, I have finished three games in collaboration with other WPI students. I'm pursuing a Technology BS in Interactive Media and Game Development.
              I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
