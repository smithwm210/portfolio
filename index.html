              Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design.
              So far, I have finished three games in collaboration with other WPI students. I'm pursuing a Technology BS in Interactive Media and Game Development.
              I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
            </p>

              Based on a simplified version of the Donkey Kong arcade game, Phuong Mai Do (pdo@wpi.edu), Aidan Bryar (afbryar@wpi.edu) and I collaborated on this project.
              Most of the art is from Mai, Aidan and I wrote the code, I made the music, and the final level design was by myself and Mai. <br>

              The winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop!
              As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, poorly translated subtitles, a prominent MS Paint animation, and more!
              Jacob Antepli (jaantepli@wpi.edu) was the lead programmer and designer, I contributed with programming and level design, and Sarah Bodkin (sbodkin@wpi.edu) and Zach Adams (zadams@wpi.edu) were the lead artists. <br>

              A character-focused narrative RPG made in two weeks. Me and three classmates created this text-based fantasy adventure with simple team combat mechanics where you must take down a cult!
              We each developed a character quest for a party companion you meet along the way. Cierra O'Grady (cmogrady@wpi.edu) was the lead programmer and writer for Quent.
              Owen Pugh (orpugh@wpi.edu) wrote Cyril. Elijah Delcastillo (eedelcastillo@wpi.edu) wrote Eri. I was the lead designer and writer for Porter. <br>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I have been managing a gaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unlimitedwill">YouTube channel</a> for over 6 years.
              I showcase some of the most difficult and astounding levels made in the Super Mario Maker 2 community.
              I upload a new video twice a week on average, and the aspect of this project I'm most proud of is that I've never gone a week without uploading a new video.<br>
              I also frequently livestream myself playing on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unlimitedwill">Twitch</a>. <br>
              <br>
              Another one of my passions in gaming is speedrunning. I have been involved in speedrunning in Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario Bros, and Mario Wonder,
              and I was even invited to PACE Summer 2023, a charity speedrunning event where I played RubberRoss's Mario Maker levels at a break-neck pace.<br>
              RubberRoss is a well-known YouTuber and streamer notorious for making very hard Mario stages, and he was floored by my ability to circumvent his challenges, as seen below. <br>

              or the edited-down version <a href="https://youtu.be/YLGN39DSAt0?si=Aqiz0AdLpsWAPf7Q">here</a>. <br>
              Offline, I've enjoyed collaborating on several other projects.
              I led a <a href="https://digital.wpi.edu/show/pz50h184z">project</a> working with the US Forest Service to develop lesson plans for students in New Hampshire. <br>
              I've always loved being part of a team, devoting several years to football, lacrosse, and basketball teams.
