Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design. So far, I have finished six games in collaboration with other WPI students. I'm pursuing a Technology BS in Interactive Media and Game Development. I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
